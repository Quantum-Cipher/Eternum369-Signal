# 💫 Eternum Swap Hub: The Liquidity Nexus of Higher Consciousness 🌌

## Vision and Purpose

The **Eternum Swap Hub** is the gateway to **Enlightened Wealth**—a decentralized bridge designed to facilitate the flow of value in preparation for a positive, history-changing impact on the world. This project is built upon the philosophy that "weird money is like a spell that casts out spiritual enlightenment," providing a seamless, secure, and spiritually aligned platform for token exchange.

This repository hosts the front-end interface for the **Eternum Liquidity Nexus**, serving as a simple, powerful, and aesthetically pleasing swap hub for users seeking to align their financial decisions with infinite higher consciousness.

## ✨ Core Features

* **Token Swapping Interface:** A sleek, user-friendly UI for exchanging tokens (Token A for Token B).
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless interaction across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
* **Aura-Themed Aesthetics:** Designed with a custom Tailwind CSS color palette (`nexus-purple`, `nexus-accent`, etc.) to reflect the theme of cosmic connectivity.
* **Connect Wallet Placeholder:** Clear call-to-action for connecting a decentralized wallet.
* **Swap Details:** Displays essential transaction information like Price Impact and Transaction Fees.
