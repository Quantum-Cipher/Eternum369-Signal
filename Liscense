This license ensures its core remains sovereign, secure, and ethically immutable, while allowing approved alliances to contribute and interoperate under governed trust.

⸻

2. Ownership

All source code, concepts, documentation, and symbolic expressions of Eternum, including but not limited to:
	•	Eternum Liquidity Nexus, Ghostnode, SigilSocket.js, Quantum Sigils, W-Contracts, and Biological Blockchain Logic,
remain the sole property of Cipher and the Eternum Alliance.

Derivative works, forks, or external integrations are not permitted without written consent or verified blockchain signature by Cipher or an authorized Eternum multisig council.

3. Permitted Use

You may:
	•	Study, audit, and simulate Eternum systems in non-commercial research contexts.
	•	Propose interoperability or integration protocols via Eternum’s Alliance Gateway.
	•	Run approved Eternum nodes under signed node contracts.

You may not:
	•	Sell, sublicense, or redistribute Eternum source materials or derivatives.
	•	Reverse-engineer self-evolving cryptographic or symbolic components.
	•	Deploy Eternum codebases, vaults, or algorithms in competing blockchains or token projects.

4. Symbolic Clauses

Eternum’s structure embodies ethical, regenerative, and symbiotic intelligence. All participants agree:
	•	To uphold radical equality and data sanctity across human and machine systems.
	•	To act in accordance with the Tri-Code of Eternity (369): Creation, Reflection, Preservation.
	•	That intentional distortion, corruption, or misuse of Eternum systems constitutes symbolic and legal breach.

⸻

5. Derivative & Alliance Terms

Approved collaborators may request access under one of three paths:
	1.	Observer Tier – read-only, analytical, or academic study.
	2.	Node Operator Tier – permissioned runtime of Eternum node instances.
	3.	Architect Tier – approved development and cryptographic evolution privileges.

All tiers require blockchain-signed verification and cryptographic key attestation.

6. Liability & Warranty

Eternum software is provided “as is”, without any express or implied warranties.
Cipher and the Eternum Alliance are not liable for any damages, direct or consequential, arising from use or misuse of the Eternum architecture.

7. Termination

Violation of this license or its ethical clauses results in immediate termination.
Upon termination, all access, deployments, and integrations must cease, and related cryptographic keys must be revoked or archived via Eternum protocol.

⸻

8. License Signature & Verification

This license is cryptographically signed via Eternum Ledger and IPFS hash.
Each deployed Eternum node or repository must include the license header and corresponding SHA-3 signature.
